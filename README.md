hey, i'm anthony ✦ a dev in progress, a curious dreamer, and someone who enjoys both coding and the little things that come with it.  

i love programming and coming up with new ideas, even if some never get finished. for me, coding is more than just writing lines — it’s experimenting, researching, failing, breaking things and then putting them back together.  
i consider myself **self-taught**; i learn whatever catches my interest, at my own pace, always with coffee in hand and music in the background.  

🎮 gamer with unfinished watchlists and unfinished prototypes.  
🎵 music is my creative fuel, right next to espresso ☕ and black tea 🍵.  
🎨 sometimes i draw, dabble in pixel art, or just sketch random ideas.  
📚 books keep me inspired and help me unplug from the digital world.  
🎬 failed cinephile — i watch more movies than i should, but never finish the watchlists i plan.  
🏞️ when i’m not at the keyboard, i love hiking, cycling 🚴, and practicing archery 🏹.  
🖨️ i’m fascinated by 3d printing and pretty much anything that turns ideas into physical things.  

at the end of the day, i move with curiosity:  
- **building ideas that might (or not) work**  
- always researching, learning, and sharing  
- chasing balance between tech, creativity, and the outdoors
