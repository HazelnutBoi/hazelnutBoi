hey, i'm anthony ✦ a dev in progress, a curious dreamer, and someone who enjoys both coding and the little things that come with it.  

i love programming and coming up with new ideas, even if some never get finished. coding for me is experimenting, researching, failing, breaking things and then putting them back together. always with coffee ☕, tea 🍵 and music 🎵 in the background.
